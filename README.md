ðŸ“Œ Deep Learning Projects Overview

This repository contains four deep learning projects demonstrating applications of neural networks in time series forecasting, natural language processing, computer vision, and tabular data classification:

Beijing Air Quality Forecasting (RNN)

Time series forecasting of PM2.5 levels in Beijing using a Simple RNN.

Covers data preprocessing, sequence generation, RNN training, and visualization of predictions against actual values.

IMDB Sentiment Analysis (BiLSTM)

Text classification of IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using a Bidirectional LSTM.

Includes sequence padding, embedding layers, model training with early stopping, evaluation, and sample sentiment predictions.

CIFAR-10 Image Classification (CNN)

Convolutional Neural Network with batch normalization, dropout, and data augmentation to classify CIFAR-10 images into 10 categories.

Implements early stopping and learning rate reduction, with visualizations of class probabilities and evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report).

Keras Fundamentals with Neural Networks (NN)

Demonstrates neural network basics on the Diabetes dataset using Keras.

Includes data preprocessing, training two simple NN architectures, evaluating performance with accuracy and ROC-AUC, and visualizing training loss and validation curves.

Technologies Used: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
